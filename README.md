Investigating perplexity in microbe regulatory sequences using NLP language modeling techniques

Class Project for CSE517 (Winter 2019, University of Washington)

For my NLP class final project, I used count-based Language Modeling technique to investigate the perplexity across various "corpora" of promoters. The idea was to see if language modeling could indeed capture some amount of the sequence patterns that exist DNA regulatory sequences. Here I focus on E. coli sequences but would eventually like to analyze a the less well-studied Methylomicrobium buryatense, a methane-eating bacteria.

This notebook is a bit of an exploratory start and was used for the analysis of my class project. Perhaps it will be extended in the future!

See Final Report PDF for further discussion of the project results.
